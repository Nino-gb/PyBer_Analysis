# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of PyBer:

PyBer is a Python Base ride-sharing app company who need to export and analyze data from csv files. To aid the process we will create several types of visualizations to tell a compelling story about the data. First, we analyze all PyBer rideshare data form January to early May of 2019. Then, we create Python script using Panda library , Jupyter Notebook and Matplotlib to build the charts that will showcase the relationship between the type of city ,the number of drivers and riders as well of the averages of the fares, riders by type of city. 

### Purpose

Use Python skills and knowledge of Pandas to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type with a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. The complete project analysis will improve access to ride-sharing services and determinate affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

Considering the above images we can conclude:

- Urban rides have 81% of the overall city type total fare with the lowest average fare per ride and average fare per drivers

- Rural rides have 3% of the overall city type total fare with the highest average fare per ride and average fare per drivers

- Lower rides demand increase average ride per ride and drivers

- Suburban outcomes balance the quantity of driver and demand of rides

- Urban total Fares are twice Suburban total fares and eight times rural total fares

- Total Ride among the city types are stable during January through May; Urban Total Fare fluctuate from $2,000-$2,500, Suburban Fare from $550-$1,500 and Rural from $50-$500


## Summary

Based on the results, we made the following recommendation to address the disparities among the city types and align the amount of rural total fares with Urban total fares:

- Increment amount of rural drivers and reduce fare cost to have a more competitive fare. This will bring new clients and provoke a significant increment in total rides and total fares

- Add a city type average expenses per ride to the Pyber summary DataFrame and line chart to determinate if the fare ride expenses influence the city type average fare per drive and average fare per driver. This factor may reveal or justify why Rural averages fare are higher than the other city type averages

- Develop a marketing plan to create promotions and subscription for rural city riders to stimulate them to use PyBer

- Perform a geographic marketing segmentation, this strategy will offer a quick and effective route to reach potential customer by location
